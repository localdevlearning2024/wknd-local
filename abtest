Imagine you're having a giant cookie party and want to see which type of cookie is the crowd favorite â€“ chocolate chip or peanut butter?

Chocolate Chip: This is your control group, the original website experience.
Peanut Butter: This is your test group, the modified website experience.

The Challenge: You want to know which cookie is the clear favorite, but you don't want to:

Run out of cookies too soon: If the test is too short (not enough guests), a few random preferences might make one pile seem more popular, even if it's not truly the favorite. This is like having a small party where a few loud voices declaring their love for peanut butter might make it seem like the winner, even if most people would have preferred chocolate chip if they had a chance.
Keep the party going forever: There's no point in dragging out the test if it's clear which cookie is winning after a while. This is like having a party where everyone has clearly devoured the chocolate chip cookies and there's barely a crumb of peanut butter left.
The Sweet Spot:

The ideal test duration is like finding the point where:

Enough guests have tried both cookies: This ensures you have a statistically significant sample size. In our analogy, it's like having enough people try both cookies to be confident that the majority truly prefer one over the other.
